# FileType-Analyzer
A simple and effective desktop tool that checks the real type of any file, detects extension spoofing, and verifies file integrity using SHA-256 and this is done without opening or executing the file.
It is useful for spotting hidden malware, phishing attachments, and suspicious downloads.
